# SWISLR - Sea Level Change Materials

Some initial science questions:

1. What is the observed sea-level change in the Hampton Roads region from altimetry and tide gauges?
1. What are the drivers of the observed sea-level change?
a. ECCO v4r5 - partition into steric vs barystatic
a. GRACE ocean bottom pressure
1. What is vertical land motion in the region?
a. git clone https://git.smce.nasa.gov/eis-sealevel/eis-sea-level-change-general.git
a. open the Vertical Land Motion Visualizer.ipynb notebook (in vlm directory)
a. run all cells to display map of vertical land motion
a. *Science question:* How variable is VLM in the region? Can we hypothesize why there might be this variability?
1. ECCO sea-surface height perturbation tool: https://ecco.smce.nasa.gov/
a. *Science question:* The ocean's response to zonal winds along the equator plays a central role in El Nino. The initial planetary wave response happens within a few months, so itâ€™s doable within the one-year limit of the tool's implementation. Have the student experiment with what happens when the perturbation is placed at different geographic locations; e.g., zonal wind perturbation at 0N, 5N, 5S, 20N, 20S all along 170E. Try the same with meridional wind, or when the perturbations are elsewhere.
1. Other datasets and tools
